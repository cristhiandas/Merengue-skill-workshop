# Merengue-skill-workshop

Okey everyone, so we made it through the second week (almost), and now we have the Merengue workshop, here what is going 
to happen:

First, I will iterate over and over againg the "Merengue counts" Array, and will pass it as an input value.
Then, you'll have to run a program that gets the input value and move a feet.

- For the guys: When the input is 1 you will move your left feet, when 2 move the right feet.
- For the ladys: When the input is 1 you will move your right feet, when 2 move the left.

The second step will be lot harder, when all the test are settled to green we will pass to the spins methods,
as a group we will choose a name for every spin and create methods that takes the name as the input value and returns
a really awesome merengue spin.

Here, I'll let you few suggestions on how to call your methods:

def move_left
end

def move_right
end

def basic_spin
end

def the_eight (This is the translation from a spin)
end

## You will need:
- Confy clothes and shoes.
- Good attitude.
- An open mind, merengue is a latin dance and you won't have personal space. (I mean it).
- A good attitude, dancing is all about fun. It really doesn't matter how you do it, if you are having fun then you are doing it right.

## What you don't need:
- Feeling embarrassed. No one was born with all the info on how to do everything, Dancing is a skill and with practice it'll become more and more natural.
- Feeling frustrated. You don't have to catch everything at once, nobody said it was easy (~it's such a shame for us to part~).

## Extra info: 
- The first 5/6 minutes will be a secret and you CANNOT tell what happens in those minutes.
- If you want to learn an specific spin you can ask me any day you want.
- I'll ask you if you want more classes to set them up.
- If you want to get in the mood for merengue go to this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeQ0DYKOqFI/)
- [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2sbQVoO3os) you can watch a professional merengue dance. (I'm not in that level nor even close so don't be worry).
